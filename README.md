This repository is the workings against a code challenge completed several years ago. I don't have the challenge I was working against, and the code is dated and unmaintained. 

While my work and approach to writing code has certainly continued to evolve, this remains a good baseline as to the work I might deliver. 

Basic CS Section A, B, C, and D are discussed in [basics.md](basics.md) 

The Advanced/Practical section is discussed in [advanced.md](advanced.md)
